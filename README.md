# College C-Sharp
## A peak into the world of the C# programming language 
<p align="justify">This repository contains all assignments, assessments, projects and self practice codes written during a college course which relates to the C# programming language. A part of the course requirement is to push assignments to github; hence this repository.</p>

## Disclamer
<p align="justify">Most codes pushed here are written by a complete novice to C#. There is no guarantee of 100 percent accuracy/precision and common conventions among professional C# writers may be broken. In this vein, please do not crucify me for any inaccuracies spotted. Yes! There might be a better way to approach some problems but please bear with me for the beginner stage.</p>
